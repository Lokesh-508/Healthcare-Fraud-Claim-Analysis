Due to this reason, insurance companies increased their insurance premiums and as result healthcare is becoming costly matter day by day.

This project will help in building tool that can be offered to insurance providers, health care providers, patients, pharmacy, and doctors and will enable Pulseinsights gain credibility in the industry, combat the increasing costs of healthcare, and costly impact of fraud.



** Common types of frauds by providers **
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project aims to analyze healthcare fraud claims. It addresses various types of fraudulent activities, including:

- Billing for services that were not provided.
- Duplicate submission of a claim for the same service.
- Misrepresenting the service provided.
- Charging for a more complex or expensive service than was actually provided.
- Billing for a covered service when the service actually provided was not covered.

## Solution Proposal

We have developed a solution using AI/ML and other technologies to detect healthcare claims fraud. Our solution utilizes patient, provider, and claims data in collaboration with the payer to identify fraudulent activities. The process, known as claims adjudication, involves verifying the submitted claims and making decisions on accepting or rejecting them.

The key features of our solution include:

- Utilizing patient, provider, and claims data to detect fraudulent activities.
- Thoroughly verifying crucial details such as diagnosis, patient ID, patient date of birth, and procedure code.
- Cross-checking coverage details against the payer's internal records to determine covered benefits.
- Plug-and-play solution with configurable input data sources.
- Easy adaptability to fit into different stages of the claims processing workflow.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes the following:

- Inpatient Data: Provides insights into claims filed for patients admitted to hospitals, including admission and discharge dates and diagnosis codes.
- Outpatient Data: Details claims filed for patients who visit hospitals but are not admitted.
- Beneficiary Details Data: Contains beneficiary KYC details such as health conditions and region.
